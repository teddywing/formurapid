NAME
----
formurapid - Fill in a PDF form using a text file

SYNOPSIS
--------
'formurapid' [options] (--generate | --fill) 'pdf_file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Fill in a PDF form based on the values in a TOML text file. This allows the
values to be saved and reused. The TOML file can also be manipulated by
external programs to calculate or fill in values in an interoperable format
without having to directly manipulate the PDF.

First, generate the TOML file with:

	$ formurapid --generate a-form.pdf

This will produce two files: 'a-form-ids.pdf' and 'a-form.toml'. The IDs PDF
includes text fields filled in with their corresponding ID. The TOML file
associates values with field IDs.

Once the TOML file is generated and stored in the same directory as
'a-form.pdf', the form can be filled in with:

	$ formurapid --fill a-form.pdf

The above command generates a file 'a-form-filled.pdf', a version of
'a-form.pdf' with form fields filled using the values in 'a-form.toml'.

OPTIONS
